Subject: Task 1 Completion â€” Cloud Application Registration

Hello Daniel,

I have completed Task 1 of our cloud setup assignment. Since I use AWS, I registered our first application in AWS rather than Azure. Here are the details:

- Application Name: wcd-bank-app
- Cloud Platform: AWS
- Service Used: IAM (Identity & Access Management)
- Purpose: Enable authentication between the WCD Bank app and AWS cloud services for CI/CD and testing.
- Status: IAM user created with programmatic access; credentials generated and stored securely.

All setup steps were followed, and the application is now ready for integration in future tasks.

Please let me know if you need any additional screenshots or details.

Best regards,
Harsh Chourasia
